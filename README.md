# Fastest-lap üèÅüèé

Fastest-lap is a vehicle dynamics simulator. It can be used to understand vehicle dynamics, to learn about driving techniques, to design car prototypes, or just for fun!

### What can be done

- [Numerical G-G diagram][gg]: given a vehicle, and a speed, to compute its ax-ay diagram. The G-G diagram is a useful technique in vehicle design and parameters exploration.

  This is solved as an optimization problem: for a given lateral acceleration, find the minimum/maximum feasible longitudinal acceleration.

- [Optimal laptime simulation][optimal-laptime]: given a vehicle, and a circuit, to compute the optimal controls that minimize the laptime.

  This problem is solved using a first order collocation method, the trapezoidal rule, with higher-order methods planned to be implemented soon. The NLP is solved using [Ipopt][ipopt], and [CppAD][cppad] to enhance its performance (a lap-time around Circuit de Catalunya can be obtained with 500 points in approximately 1 minute).

  This is not a quasi-steady-state simulation. The model solves the fully transient states as in the dynamic equations without steady-state assumptions.

### The approach

The core of the software is a C++ library, that can be used through a Python API. Full documentation is not yet available but some examples can be found in [examples/python][examples-python]. Fastest-lap is very efficient, being able to compute a full optimal lap in less than 1 minute.

### Dynamic models

The code implements two car models:

- A [3DOF car model][link8] (longitudinal, lateral, and yaw), currently used for F1 simulations. The default parameters used can be found in [./database/limebeer-2014-f1.xml][database-f1]
- A [6DOF car model][link2] (longitudinal, lateral, vertial, yaw, pitch and roll), currently used for Go-kart simulations. The default parameters used can be found in [./database/roberto-lot-2016-kart.xml][database]

### Circuits

Circuits are modeled from paths created from google earth, for example, the right track limit of Catalunya is included in this repository ([database/google_earth/Catalunya_right.kml][catalunya_right.kml]). Circuits are then preprocessed with a tool included herein to extract a reference line, its curvature, and the distance to the left/right track limits ([database/catalunya_discrete.xml][catalunya_discrete]).

### Dependencies

Fastest-lap uses several open-source libraries:

- [Ipopt][ipopt]: Interior Point OPTimizer, is an open source software package for large-scale nonlinear optimization. Used within this project to obtain the solution to optimal laptime problems written as NLP (Non-linear programming problem).
- [CppAD][cppad]: C++ Algorithmic Differentiation. Distributed alongside Ipopt, it is used to compute analytical derivatives.
- [Tinyxml2][tinyxml2]: TinyXML-2 is a simple, small, efficient, C++ XML parser, used to read XML files (e.g. model parameters, tracks,...)
- [logger-cpp][loggercpp]: a simple logger in C++, to handle print levels, and other interesting add-ons
- [lion-cpp][lioncpp]: lightweigh interfaces for optimization and numerics, a C++ package manager for all the libraries mentioned above, plus other numerical methods such as mechanical frames, vector algebra, and Runge--Kutta schemes

### Compilation

This project uses CMake to build the source code and produce the binaries.

The canonical steps to compile a CMake project are: (assume `$FASTESTLAP` is the source code top level.)

1.  Create a build folder.

```
mkdir ${FASTESTLAP}/build
```

2. From the build folder, run cmake

```
cd ${FASTESTLAP}/build && cmake ..
```

The options available for cmake are:

```
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug/Release
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir
-DCODE_COVERAGE=Yes/No: enables code coverage (if so, use with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug)
-DBUILD_DOC=Yes/No: builds doxygen documentation
```

At this stage, CMake will download and install all the thirdparty dependencies.

3. Compile

```
make
```

4. Test (optional but recommended)

```
ctest --verbose
```

5. Install (optional)

```
make install
```

#### Linux

A Docker build environment is provided and can be used to compile the shared library and generate the Python bindings.

```shell
sh ./src/scripts/linux/docker_compile.sh
```
